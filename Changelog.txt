classicalmechanics.V0.1.16-0.pdf (current version)

classicalmechanics.V0.1.15-3.pdf, Dec 31 2020 (commit 1a33e9530f5)
- Switch to plain L for Lagrangians and calL for Lagrangian densities (use \Lq macro to allow for easy switch back.)
- New STA content (rough): reciprocal frames, gradient, vector derivative, line and surface integrals and fundamental theorems for both.

classicalmechanics.V0.1.13-5.pdf, Oct 24 2020, (commit 7b9e0539da)

- Pruned 87 pages (some just tossed, other stuff rewritten.)
- junk: 1dharmonicOsc.tex 1dpotentialIntegral.tex InfinitePlanePotentialTakeIII.tex cylinderPotential.tex infiniteSheetPotentials.tex lForceLag2.tex lorentzForce.tex lorentzForcePQA.tex lorentzMetricTensor.tex maxwellTensorLagrangian.tex multiPendulumSpherical2.tex newtonianLagrangianAndGradient.tex quadraticForm.tex sPolarMultiPendulum.tex srLagrangian.tex waveLagrangian.tex
- new chapter content: covariantSTA.tex, sta.tex (replaces various poorer versions)
- convert jackson12Dash9 into problem, and fix gutter issues.
- move remainder of \part{Lagrangian Topics} to appendix.
- junk a bunch of stuff
- move multiPendulumSphericalMatrix.tex
- split galagrangian/eulerLagrange.tex into E-L and Noether parts.
- split off waveLagrangianDirac.tex, waveLagrangianKG.tex, waveLagrangianQM.tex
- move some of mine/waveLagrangian.tex into problems.
- convert hoopSpring.tex into a problem.
- Try to impose some basic structure.

classicalmechanics.V0.1.12-22.pdf, Oct 12 2020, (commit 75aaee7e385)

- Converted dmath* and equation* s to labelled equations.
- Removed sentances that started with "Or,".
- Internal cleanups: remove unless {aligned} enviornments, subequations of one equation, switch from {align} envionrment to equation + aligned.
- Fixup equation grammar in many places (periods and commas)
- Removed lots of the blank lines that forced undesirable latex paragraph breaks.
- Lots of gutter and equation overflow fixes (many caused by the 6x9 transition.)
- Remove parts.
- Updated email address.
- Listing hyphenation fix.
- url fixes.
- thethe.py fixes.
- Switch to 6x9 format
- Move chapter headings into chapters.tex
