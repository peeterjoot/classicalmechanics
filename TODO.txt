index most of these.

- incorporate lorentzForceCovariant.tex and rip out old stuff.

- audit: Use L for non-field lagrangian, and \LL for field lagrangian.

- solve: 

   mine/waveLagrangianQM.tex
   mine/waveLagrangianKG.tex
   mine/waveLagrangianDirac.tex

- There is very little structure in these notes.Â  An extremely vicious edit is required, and it would be good to have standalone introductions to all the key ideas before diving into the problems.

- Add indexing for chapter,section,paragraph,problems

- Switch problems done as chapters to just plain problem/answer templates.

- Rework some mult part goldstein and tong problems in makesubquestion/subanswer format.
