- tags from lorentzForceCovariant.tex blog post:

   action, anti-commutator, commutator, coordinates, covariant, Dirac algebra, Dirac matrix, dot product, Einstein convention, extremize action, Faraday bivector, Faraday tensor, frame, Geometric Algebra, gradient, Lorentz force, Lorentz force Lagrangian, Lorentz invariant, minimize action, observer frame, Pauli matrix, proper momentum, proper time, proper velocity, pseudoscalar, reciprocal basis, relativity, spacelike, spacetime gradient, STA, standard basis, tensor algebra, timelike, wedge product

   index most of these.

- Incorporate lorentzForceCovariant.tex and rip out old stuff.

   - Split first parts into an STA chapter.
   - Remove :
      "Because I intend to expand these notes to include purely non-relativistic applications, I won't use the Pauli notation here."

- 

Move to .junk/ has left all the following dead references: track these down, and update:

  Reference `chap:PJSrLagrangian' on page 253 undefined on input line 731
  Reference `chap:PJSrLagrangian' on page 255 undefined on input line 15
  Reference `chap:PJSrLorentzForce' on page 253 undefined on input line 749
  Reference `chap:PJSrLorentzForce' on page 255 undefined on input line 15


- audit: Use L for non-field lagrangian, and \LL for field lagrangian.

- solve:

   mine/waveLagrangianQM.tex
   mine/waveLagrangianKG.tex
   mine/waveLagrangianDirac.tex

- There is very little structure in these notes.Â  An extremely vicious edit is required, and it would be good to have standalone introductions to all the key ideas before diving into the problems.

- Add indexing for chapter,section,paragraph,problems

- Switch problems done as chapters to just plain problem/answer templates.

- Rework some mult part goldstein and tong problems in makesubquestion/subanswer format.
