   \chapter{Maybe interesting: alternate covariant kinetic Lagrangian.}
      \input{maybeInterestingAlternateCovariantKineticLagrangian.tex}

- an interesting way to write the Lorentz force Lagrangian (related to canonical momentum or a gauge transformation?)

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:lorForcePqA:interactionLagPsq}
\LL
= \inv{2 m}\left( m v + \frac{q}{c} A \right)^2 - \frac{q^2}{ 2 m c^2} A^2.
\end{equation}

- could turn into a problem:

\begin{equation}
L = \inv{2} m\Bv^2 - \varphi.
\end{equation}
...
In terms of the gradient operator, and with \(\Bv = \sum \Be_i \dot{x}^i\), that is
%
\begin{equation}
\BF = \frac{d (m \Bv)}{dt} = - \grad \varphi.
\end{equation}

(only thing good from .junk/newtonianLagrangianAndGradient.tex)

- an observation from tongMf1LorentzForceLagrangianJunk.tex that's worth keeping:

   Notice the sign in the potential term, which is negative, unlike the same Lagrangian in relativistic (proper) form: \(\LL = \inv{2}m v^2 + q A \cdot v/c\).  That difference is required
   since the lack of the use of time as one of the generalized coordinates will change the signs of some of the results.
   Now, this does not matter for this particular problem, but also observe that this Lagrangian is almost in its proper form.  All we have to do is add a \(-\inv{2} m c^2\) constant to it, which should not effect the equations of motion.  Doing so yields:
   \begin{equation}\label{eqn:tongMf1:1760}
   \LL = \inv{2} m (-c^2 + \Bv^2) - q A \cdot v/c = - \left( \inv{2} mv^2 + q A \cdot v/c \right).
   \end{equation}

- have moved:

multiPendulumSpherical2.tex

to .junk/

there were some interesting ideas in there, but it is very redundant with this tackled in a scalar fashion in this book too.  If I can figure out a better application, then perhaps resurrect some of this again.

Move to .junk/ has left all the following dead references: track these down, and update:

  Reference `chap:PJSrLagrangian' on page 253 undefined on input line 731
  Reference `chap:PJSrLagrangian' on page 255 undefined on input line 15
  Reference `chap:PJSrLorentzForce' on page 253 undefined on input line 749
  Reference `chap:PJSrLorentzForce' on page 255 undefined on input line 15


- audit: Use L for non-field lagrangian, and \LL for field lagrangian.

- solve:

   mine/waveLagrangianQM.tex
   mine/waveLagrangianKG.tex
   mine/waveLagrangianDirac.tex

- There is very little structure in these notes.Â  An extremely vicious edit is required, and it would be good to have standalone introductions to all the key ideas before diving into the problems.

- Add indexing for chapter,section,paragraph,problems

- Switch problems done as chapters to just plain problem/answer templates.

- Rework some mult part goldstein and tong problems in makesubquestion/subanswer format.
