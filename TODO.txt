- Proofing checklist:

   - (Convert parts to chapters), first converting section -> subsection or paragraph.  review existing subsections/paragraphs.
   - Equation grammar: review after the bulk period additions: on pg 99 (ch 10)
   - Make sure all the indexing is done.  at least chapter,section,paragraph,problems
   - have too many equation* and dmath* -- turn those into unstarred unless they are part of problem statements.
   - modify the aligned remover script to search for equations with one & and no \\'s.  then strip those!
   - sentances that start with 'Or,'

   - make dist, tag
   - push
   - copy to kdp, leanpub, landing page.
   - bump version.



=========

   - solve and write up the other phy354 problem sets and the midterm and final.  problem set 2 i/p.  want to look at the E - q \phi and do a comparison between the relativistic and non-rel results to see how they compare for small v.

   - have at least one complete lecture on paper and some partially written up lecture notes to finish up and add here.

   - rework some mult part goldstein and tong problems in makesubquestion/subanswer format.
