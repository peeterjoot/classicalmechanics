there were other blog posts associated with that pdf (at least two.)  Grab the tags from those too.

- Reincorporate as first example of the field Euler-Lagrange equations.  Was in lagrangianFieldDensity.tex
%
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:lagrangianFieldDensity:1474}
\spacegrad^2 \overbar{\phi} = \rho/2 \kappa,
\end{equation}
%
provided we set the constant \(\kappa = -\epsilon_0/2\).  This also fixes the unknown constant in the associated Lagrangian density and action
%
\begin{equation}
S = \int_{\Omega} \left(- \frac{\epsilon_0}{2} (\spacegrad \phi)^2 + \rho \phi \right) d\Omega.
\end{equation}
%

(this was originally done as a 2D example.  Make it a 3D one)

- Reincorporate as first example of the Euler-Lagrange equations.  Was in lagrangianFieldDensity.tex

Suppose we have an action associated with a kinetic Lagrangian density \((1/2) m v^2\)
%
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:maxFieldLag:oneDimKinetic}
S = \int_a^b \frac{m}{2} { \left(\frac{dx}{dt}\right) }^2 dt,
\end{equation}
%
where \(x = x(t)\) is the undetermined function to solve for.  Feynman's technique is similar to \citep{goldstein1951cm} way of deriving the Euler Lagrange equations, but instead of writing

...
That is
%
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:lagrangianFieldDensity:1334}
\frac{d^2\overbar{x}}{dt^2} = 0.
\end{equation}
%
As the solution to the extreme value problem.  This is nothing but the equation for a straight line, which is what we expect if there are no external forces
%
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:lagrangianFieldDensity:1354}
\overbar{x} - x_0 = v(t - t_0).
\end{equation}

- what was the point of \eqnref -- replace with \cref?

- need to reconcile the gradient approach that I used in lorentzForceCovariant with Lagrangians with more generalized coordinates than the size of the vector space.  In particular, a two particle system in R^2 or R^3 could have 4-6 generalized coordinates.

that's probably why the 

\PD{\Br}{} 
\PD{\dot{\Br}}{} 

notation is preferred in some cases.  This can reduce to the gradient (spacegrad or grad) in specific cases.

Does it make sense to present the generalized coordinate case first, before the vector approach used in lorentzForceCovariant?

- have some todos left in covariantSTA.tex (one is just the expansion of the energy side of the Lorentz force equation (dotting with gamma_0 instead of wedging)

- need an integrated treatment of gauge transformations.  Examples to consider include the gauge transformation for the field in the Lorentz force Lagrangian:

   A -> A + \grad \psi

Is it possible to transform v -> v + \grad \psi to introduce the coupling of the Lorentz force?  Lookup gauge transformation notes in poppitz phy2403 and phy450 notes (and perhaps Arun's grad quantum too)

- Review how coupling was modelled in the Lagrangian (believe it was with an additional parameter).

- in canonicalMomentum.tex I identified:

   p = \grad_v \LL

and the canonical (covariant) momentum.  That is probably still worth noting somewhere.

- review:

   \chapter{Maybe interesting: alternate covariant kinetic Lagrangian.}
      \input{maybeInterestingAlternateCovariantKineticLagrangian.tex}

- an interesting way to write the Lorentz force Lagrangian (related to canonical momentum or a gauge transformation?)

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:lorForcePqA:interactionLagPsq}
\LL
= \inv{2 m}\left( m v + \frac{q}{c} A \right)^2 - \frac{q^2}{ 2 m c^2} A^2.
\end{equation}

- could turn into a problem:

\begin{equation}
L = \inv{2} m\Bv^2 - \varphi.
\end{equation}
...
In terms of the gradient operator, and with \(\Bv = \sum \Be_i \dot{x}^i\), that is
%
\begin{equation}
\BF = \frac{d (m \Bv)}{dt} = - \grad \varphi.
\end{equation}

(only thing good from .junk/newtonianLagrangianAndGradient.tex)

- an observation from tongMf1LorentzForceLagrangianJunk.tex that's worth keeping:

   Notice the sign in the potential term, which is negative, unlike the same Lagrangian in relativistic (proper) form: \(\LL = \inv{2}m v^2 + q A \cdot v/c\).  That difference is required
   since the lack of the use of time as one of the generalized coordinates will change the signs of some of the results.
   Now, this does not matter for this particular problem, but also observe that this Lagrangian is almost in its proper form.  All we have to do is add a \(-\inv{2} m c^2\) constant to it, which should not effect the equations of motion.  Doing so yields:
   \begin{equation}\label{eqn:tongMf1:1760}
   \LL = \inv{2} m (-c^2 + \Bv^2) - q A \cdot v/c = - \left( \inv{2} mv^2 + q A \cdot v/c \right).
   \end{equation}

- have moved:

multiPendulumSpherical2.tex

to .junk/

there were some interesting ideas in there, but it is very redundant with this tackled in a scalar fashion in this book too.  If I can figure out a better application, then perhaps resurrect some of this again.

- There is very little structure in these notes.Â  An extremely vicious edit is required, and it would be good to have standalone introductions to all the key ideas before diving into the problems.

- Add indexing for chapter,section,paragraph,problems

- Switch problems done as chapters to just plain problem/answer templates.

- Rework some mult part goldstein and tong problems in makesubquestion/subanswer format.
