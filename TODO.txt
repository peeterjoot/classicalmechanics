- Proofing checklist:

   - Convert parts to chapters, first converting section -> subsection or paragraph.  review existing subsections/paragraphs.
   - Fix gutter overflow issues.
   - Blank line purge.
   - Equation grammar.
   - Spell check.
   - Periods for examples, figures, section, subsection, paragraphs.
   - Run urlcheckerpy
   - Run thethe.py
   - Don't use dmath+aligned:  grep -nB1 {aligned} `cat thefiles` | grep {dmath}
   - Look for dmaths in makeproblem, makeexamples, and itemize that lead to inset equation numbers.
   - Check for equations that overlap equation numbers.
   - Check the size of the figures.
   - Check indexes for entries with different spelling/case.
   - Make sure all the indexing is done.  at least chapter,section,paragraph,problems



   - make dist, tag
   - push
   - copy to kdp, leanpub, landing page.
   - bump version.



=========

   - solve and write up the other phy354 problem sets and the midterm and final.  problem set 2 i/p.  want to look at the E - q \phi and do a comparison between the relativistic and non-rel results to see how they compare for small v.

   - have at least one complete lecture on paper and some partially written up lecture notes to finish up and add here.

   - rework some mult part goldstein and tong problems in makesubquestion/subanswer format.
