%Google shows that this is a problem found in \citep{landau1960classical}.  The argument there doesn't even rely on knowing what the form of the Lagrangian is (something I tried to calculate, and had trouble doing so).  %It would be nice to read that chapter of the text before attempting that problem, but that's not one that I have. ... ordered.

%\makeoproblem{``Hidden'' symmetries and integrals of motion}{classicalMechanicsPs2:problem:3}
%{2012 PHY354 Problem set 2, problem 3}
%{
%Consider the equation of motion of a particle of charge q moving in the field of a magnetic monopole:
%
%\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:classicalMechanicsPs2:330}
%\BB = g \frac{\Br}{r^3}, \BE = 0.
%\end{dmath}
%
%Here \(g\) is the magnetic charge, which can be found using the magnetic analogue of Gausses law: \(4 \pi Q_{\mathrm{magn}} = \int_{S^2} d\BSigma \cdot \BB = 4 \pi g\).  In this problem, do not start with a Lagrangian
%,but simply use the Lorentz force
%equation. Since we no longer deal with central forces, the angular momentum is no longer conserved, and
%the motion is no longer necessarily planar. However, it can be thought that a certain amount of angular
%momentum resides in the magnetic field, and, as first observed by Poincar\'e the total angular momentumm
%
%\begin{dmath}\label{eqn:classicalMechanicsPs2:350}
%\BD = \BM + c\frac{\Br}{r}.
%\end{dmath}
%
%is conserved (here \(\BM\) is the mechanical angular momentum \(\Br \cross \Bv\), and \(c\) is a constant).
%
%\makesubproblem{Find the value of \(c\) ensuring that \(d \BD/dt = 0\) for solutions of the equations of motion.}{classicalMechanicsPs2:problem:3:1}
%\makesubproblem{Show that the radius vector of the trajectory for a particle moving in the field of a monopole obeys \(\dot{\rcap} \cdot \BD = c\), where \(\dot{\rcap} = \Br/r\).}{classicalMechanicsPs2:problem:3:2}
%\makesubproblem{For a given value of \(\BD\), determined by the initial conditions, the relation found above restricts the
%motion of the particle on a particular surface in space. Draw this surface. What happens to this
%surface when \(g \rightarrow 0\)? Is it surprising?}{classicalMechanicsPs2:problem:3:3}
%\makesubproblem{Is energy conserved? Find the energy of the particle \(\calE\) as a function of \(\Bv\), \(\Br\), ... as appropriate to the case in hand.}{classicalMechanicsPs2:problem:3:4}
%
%Note that it is a fun and challenging problem to find \(\BA\) for the magnetic monopole, but it does not belong in this class.  Besides being a fun problem, the moral here is that finding symmetries and the related integrals of motion is not always so obvious. Usually, when integrals of motion exist, they are due to a symmetry. In this example, there is a ``hidden'' symmetry responsible for the conservation of \(\BD\).
